Start/Stop | 1       | Starts/Stops the simulation.
           |         | You can change the speed via the scale widget.
Step       | 2       | Performs one single update.
Clear      | 3       | Clears the board and prepare a new simulation for being run.
Random     | 4       | Randomly fills half the surface of the board with alive cells.
Reset      | 5       | When a file is open and modified, cancels any change.
Glider gun | 6       | Spawns a gun that eternally launches gliders.
Spacefiller| 7       | Spawns a special figure that fills the board. 
Open       | Ctrl+O  | Opens a file and initalizes the simulation with its content.
Save as    | Ctrl+S  | Saves the current state of the simulation in a text file, 
           |         | which can then be opened to resume the simulation.
Quit       | Ctrl+Q  | Quits the application.
Zoom in    | Ctrl++  | Zooms in by 10%.
Zoom out   | Ctrl+-  | Zooms out by 10%.
Reset zoom | Ctrl+0  | Resets the zoom level to 0 (100%).
Show grid  |         | Displays a light gray grid over the board.
           |         | It can help spawning alive cells on the board with the mouse.

Experiment | Ctrl+T  | Enables/Disables the experiment mode. In this mode,
           |         | the simulation stops as soon as the evolution stabilizes.

           | j       | Moves the view frame up
           | k       | Moves the view frame down

World size
=> Extend  | Ctrl+PageUp  | Increases the size of the board (virtual world) by 50px.
=> Shrink  | Ctrl+PageDown| Decreases the size of the board by 50px.

Refresh rate|        | Lets you change the speed of the simulation.
            |        | The smaller the rate, the higher the fps. 
            |        | Be sure to stop and restart the simulation for the change to take effect.
